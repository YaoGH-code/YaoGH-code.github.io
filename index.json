By utilizing interfaces such as “uthread_create” and “uthread_join,” users familiar with POSIX threads can easily develop programs with user-level parallelism. The context of user-level threads in this project is implemented through a combination of our custom “uthread” data structure and the “ucontext” functionality provided by POSIX. Additionally, a lock-free data structure is employed to maintain each worker thread efficiently. The scheduling of user threads relies heavily on signals in this project. When a signal arrives, it indicates the start of the next scheduling round for each worker thread. The stack prepared by the kernel for the signal handler is crucial for smooth context switching. To ensure thread safety at the user level, interfaces such as “umalloc,” “uprintf,” and “uthread_mutex_lock” are provided. These interfaces facilitate safe memory allocation, printing, and mutual exclusion. This thread library is compatible with machines running MacOS or Linux with x86 architecture CPUs. Extensive testing has been conducted to verify the correctness and scalability of the system.\n","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"8b3621a7d9b5f8e4e83360edae723b4f","permalink":"http://yaogh-code.github.io/post/uthread/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/uthread/","section":"post","summary":"CMU 15-618 Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming final project","tags":["Academic","Open Source"],"title":"A Preemptive User-Level Thread Library","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yao (John) Xu"],"categories":["Learning notes"],"content":" ","date":1682848800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682848800,"objectID":"e38d3482014a56edb2e5a7d9b068c7ba","permalink":"http://yaogh-code.github.io/post/leetcode/","publishdate":"2023-04-30T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/leetcode/","section":"post","summary":"Learning notes about Leetcode Questions","tags":["Academic","Learning notes"],"title":"Data Structures and Algorithms (C++)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yao (John) Xu"],"categories":["Operating System","C Programming"],"content":"Repo Link: https://github.com/YaoGH-code/MemSim\nOverview ","date":1682820000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682820000,"objectID":"a6dbda7f61dfb17a4832099b9de27242","permalink":"http://yaogh-code.github.io/post/vmp_sim/","publishdate":"2023-04-30T02:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/vmp_sim/","section":"post","summary":"The C implementation of a virtual memory and process scheduling simulator","tags":["Academic","Open Source"],"title":"A Simulator of Virtual Memory and Process Scheduling","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yao (John) Xu"],"categories":["CPU design","Computer Architecture","Verilog"],"content":"Repo Link https://github.com/YaoGH-code/mCPU\nIntroduction The MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) architecture is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture that has played a significant role in the development of microprocessors. MIPS architecture features a clean and streamlined instruction set, emphasizing simplicity and efficiency. It focuses on optimizing the performance of frequently used instructions, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including embedded systems, consumer electronics, networking equipment, and high-performance computing.\nOne of the distinguishing characteristics of MIPS is its fixed instruction format, where instructions are encoded in a 32-bit word. This fixed-format allows for efficient decoding and pipelining, enabling high-performance execution and reducing the complexity of the microarchitecture. MIPS processors employ a five-stage pipeline, including instruction fetch, instruction decode, execution, memory access, and write-back. This pipelining technique enables instructions to be processed concurrently, maximizing the overall throughput of the processor.\nDesign The picture above shows the structure and components of this CPU. This CPU is composed of 5 stages, which are: Instruction Fetch(IF), Instruction Decode(ID), Execution(EXE), Memory(MEM) and Write Back(WB) stage.\nIF Stage The Instruction Fetch stage consists of three components. Firstly, there is the program counter register, which holds the physical address of the next instruction in the instruction memory (represented here as a simplified memory structure). In each cycle, an adder increments the address by 4, and the resulting address is stored in the program counter for the next clock cycle. Simultaneously, the instruction memory, equipped with an input port and an output port, fetches an instruction using the address from the program counter. This fetched instruction is then stored in the IF/ID register during the same cycle.\nID Stage In the instruction decoding stage, we can clearly see the connection between the instruction set and the actual electronic circuit. First, the instruction will be decoded into following components:\nop code: basic operation of the instruction rs: the first register source operand rt: the second register source operand rd: the register destination operand shamt: shift amount to be used in shift instructions funct code: function code imm: immediate value Combining the Op code (bits 31-26) and funct code (bits 5-0) in MIPS instructions enables the hardware to determine the current instruction and its corresponding function. For example, instructions for basic arithmetic operation(R-format) have the same op code 0x0 but with a different funct code. So, Op code and funct code combined will be provided to the control unit for generating control signals for later stages. These control signals will be covered later.\nThere is also a MUX in the MIPS architecture that utilizes the control signal “regrt” to select either the “rd” or “rt” register. The selected signal, along with the data to be written back to the register file, is then passed back to the ID stage. This MUX serves the purpose of determining the appropriate destination for the write-back operation. For instance, instructions with an opcode of 0 will select the “rd” register as the destination. On the other hand, for the LW (Load Word) instruction, the data retrieved from the data memory during the MEM stage will be written back to the register specified by the “rt” register. Therefore, the MUX helps decide which part of the instruction contains the desired destination for the write-back operation.\nThe signals “rs” and “rt” are used to access the register file and read the data stored in registers “rs” and “rt” simultaneously through the “qa” and “qb” ports. Additionally, the immediate value (imm) is sign extended and passed to the ALU for computation. This computation takes place during the EXE stage, where the ALU performs operations using the immediate value and other relevant data.\nThen, let’s look at the control signals generated by the control unit:\nwreg: A write back to register will happen in the lifecycle of the current instruction m2reg: A write back to register with data in memory will happen in the lifecycle of the current instruction wmem: A write to memory will happen in the lifecycle of the current instruction aluc: ALU operation mode ex. if aluc==b0010, then ALU_out \u0026lt;= ALU_a + ALU_b; aluimm: A immediate value is needed by the ALU to finish this operation EXE Stage In the EXE (Execute) stage, two signals are employed to control the ALU’s input sources and operation mode. Firstly, the “ealuc” signal is utilized to select the desired operation mode for the ALU. For instance, a value of “b0010” would indicate that the ALU should perform an addition operation on its two input numbers.\nSecondly, the “ealuimm” signal determines the source of the input port “b” of the ALU. …","date":1682812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682812800,"objectID":"e4519e50a6915a7d300d74618bf3a90a","permalink":"http://yaogh-code.github.io/post/mcpu/","publishdate":"2023-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mcpu/","section":"post","summary":"A 5-stage pipeline MIPS CPU implemented in Verilog","tags":["Academic","Open Source"],"title":"A 5-stage pipeline MIPS CPU","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yao (John) Xu"],"categories":["Learning notes"],"content":" 1. Introduction The make utility automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them. You need a file called a makefile to tell make what to do. Most often, the makefile tells make how to compile and link a program.\nSyntax A Makefile contains some rules with the following shape:\ntarget … : prerequisites … recipe … … A target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as ‘clean’. The prerequisites are also file names, separated by spaces. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run. These are also called dependencies. The commands are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These need to start with a tab character, not spaces. Here is a typical Makefile - one that compiles a single C file:\ntest: cc test.c -o test We can simply running make. Since there’s no target supplied as an argument to the make command, the first target is run. In this case, there’s only one target (test). The first time you run this, test will be created. The second time, you’ll see make: ’test’ is up to date. That’s because the test file already exists. But there’s a problem: if we modify test.c and then run make, nothing gets recompiled.\nInstead, we can do this:\ntest: test.c cc test.c -o test When we run make again, the following set of steps happens:\nThe first target is selected, because the first target is the default target This has a prerequisite of test.c Make decides if it should run the test target. It will only run if test doesn’t exist, or test.c is newer than test. Here is a more complicated example:\nedit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o main.o : main.c defs.h cc -c main.c kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h cc -c kbd.c command.o : command.c defs.h command.h cc -c command.c display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c display.c insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c insert.c search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c search.c files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h cc -c files.c utils.o : utils.c defs.h cc -c utils.c clean : rm edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o Edit is a target that requires eight prerequisites. The command is to compile executable file “edit” with eight object files. Each of the object file requires some C files and header files. We do not need to include header file name in the command since it is already included in the C file and the purpose to include header files in the prerequisites is to make sure the file is already there, just like a additional verification.\nWhen a target is a file, it needs to be recompiled or relinked if any of its prerequisites change. In addition, any prerequisites that are themselves automatically generated should be updated first. In this example, edit depends on each of the eight object files; the object file main.o depends on the source file main.c and on the header file defs.h.\nMake clean The target ‘clean’ is not a file, but merely the name of an action. Since you normally do not want to carry out the actions in this rule, ‘clean’ is not a prerequisite of any other rule. Consequently, make never does anything with it unless you tell it specifically. Note that this rule not only is not a prerequisite, it also does not have any prerequisites, so the only purpose of the rule is to run the specified recipe. Targets that do not refer to files but are just actions are called phony targets.\nVariables If a new object file is added to the system, we might add it to one list and forget the other, such duplication is error-prone. Instead, we can do this:\nobjects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o edit : $(objects) cc -o edit $(objects) main.o : main.c defs.h cc -c main.c kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h cc -c kbd.c command.o : command.c defs.h command.h cc -c command.c display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c display.c insert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c insert.c search.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h cc -c search.c files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h cc -c files.c utils.o : utils.c defs.h cc -c utils.c clean : rm edit $(objects) Other examples of using variables:\na := one two # a is assigned to the string \u0026#34;one two\u0026#34; all: printf \u0026#39;$a\u0026#39; x := dude all: echo $(x) echo ${x} Letting make Deduce the Recipes It is not necessary to spell out the recipes for compiling the individual C source files, because make can figure them out: it has an implicit rule for updating a ‘.o’ file from a correspondingly named ‘.c’ file using a ‘cc -c’ command. For example, it will use the recipe ‘cc -c main.c -o main.o’ to compile main.c into main.o. We can therefore omit the recipes from the rules for the object files.\nWhen a ‘.c’ file is used automatically in this way, …","date":1682726400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682726400,"objectID":"0d2ed62a94a6dcef9e4b04b45a393774","permalink":"http://yaogh-code.github.io/post/makefile/","publishdate":"2023-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/makefile/","section":"post","summary":"Learning notes about make","tags":["Academic","Learning notes"],"title":"About Make","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yao (John) Xu"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
